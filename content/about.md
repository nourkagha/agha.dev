# Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nour, a computer engineer and software developer from Lebanon. I'm an [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality), dreamer, writer, gamer, and a progressive and uplifting electronic music listener, producer and DJ. I'm currently working in a support role in the digital dentistry field, helping and enabling dental professionals to design, craft and spread more smiles.

I'm a free and open source software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) enthusiast and a privacy, security, digital freedom and humane technology advocate. I'm interested in science and philosophy and I'm passionate about [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics), academically and professionally. My favourite literary and entertainment genres are sci-fi and fantasy. I enjoy music, writing, gaming and football as hobbies, and I have a beautiful cat called Lucine.

# Background

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Engineering and graduated from the [University of Balamand](http://balamand.edu.lb) in Koura, Lebanon. I had previously spent two years at the [American University of Beirut](https://aub.edu.lb) where I lived on campus in Bliss Street, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering as a major. Both programs are [ABET](https://abet.org) accredited. My focus is computer science and programming with experience in algorithms, data structures and object-oriented programming, and I have a strong foundational background in electric circuits, electronics, microcontrollers, microprocessors and embedded systems, in addition to cybersecurity, networking, telecommunications, digital and analog signal processing, automation and programmable logic controllers.

I attended [The International School of Choueifat](https://isckoura.sabis.net) ([SABIS](https://sabis.net)) in Koura, Lebanon for fifteen years from kindergarten until high school, where I graduated with a Lebanese Baccalaureate certificate in General Sciences. Mathematics, physics and computing were by far my best and favourite academic subjects, and majoring in computer engineering and becoming an engineer was always a clear and easy choice. I also enjoyed learning other sciences such as biology and chemistry, and philosophy, literature and music when it came to arts.
