Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nour, a computer engineer and software developer from Lebanon. I'm an [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality), dreamer, writer, and progressive and uplifting electronic music listener, producer and DJ. I'm currently working in a support role in the digital dentistry field, helping and enabling dental professionals to design, craft and spread more smiles.

I'm a free and open source software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) enthusiast and privacy, security, digital freedom and humane technology advocate. I'm interested in science and philosophy and I'm passionate about [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics), academically and professionally. My favourite literary and entertainment genres are sci-fi and fantasy. I enjoy music, writing, gaming and football as hobbies, and I have a beautiful cat called Lucine.
