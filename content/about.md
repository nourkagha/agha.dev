# Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nour, a computer engineer and software developer from Lebanon. I'm an [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality), dreamer, writer, gamer, and a progressive and uplifting electronic music listener, producer and DJ. I'm currently working in a support role in the digital dentistry field, helping and enabling dental professionals to design, craft and spread more smiles.

I'm a free and open source software ([FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)) enthusiast and a privacy, security, digital freedom and humane technology advocate. I'm interested in science and philosophy and I'm passionate about [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics), academically and professionally. My favourite literary and entertainment genres are sci-fi and fantasy. I enjoy music, writing, gaming and football as hobbies, and I have a beautiful cat called Lucine.

# Background

## Education

I have a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Engineering and graduated from the [University of Balamand](http://balamand.edu.lb) in Koura, Lebanon. I had previously spent two years at the [American University of Beirut](https://aub.edu.lb) where I lived on campus in Bliss Street, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering as a major. Both programs are [ABET](https://abet.org) accredited. My focus is computer science and programming with experience in algorithms, data structures and object-oriented programming, and I have a strong foundational background in electric circuits, electronics, microcontrollers, microprocessors and embedded systems, in addition to cybersecurity, networking, telecommunications, digital and analog signal processing, automation and programmable logic controllers.

I attended [The International School of Choueifat](https://isckoura.sabis.net) ([SABIS](https://sabis.net)) in Koura, Lebanon for fifteen years from kindergarten until high school, where I graduated with a Lebanese Baccalaureate certificate in General Sciences. Mathematics, physics and computing were by far my best and favourite academic subjects, and majoring in computer engineering and becoming an engineer was always a clear and easy choice. I also enjoyed learning other sciences such as biology and chemistry, and philosophy, literature and music when it came to arts.

## Music

My electronic music journey started in 2007 with trance and house music, through legendary acts and pioneers I grew up listening to such as TiÃ«sto, Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Above & Beyond, Cosmic Gate, Dash Berlin, Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz, deadmau5, Eric Prydz, Dirty South and more.

TiÃ«sto's Elements Of Life album and Copenhagen world tour served as my intro to the genre and changed my life, which include the Cosmic Gate and Dirty South remixes of Everything and In The Dark. Cosmic Gate's Sign of the Times and Above & Beyond's Group Therapy are among my special and top albums, and Armin van Buuren's A State Of Trance 2009 & A State Of Trance 2010 are my all-time favourite mix compilations as artistic masterpieces that perfectly encapsulate the peak of a golden and genre-defining era of progressive and uplifting trance music. I've been following Armin van Buuren's A State Of Trance (ASOT) and Above & Beyond's Group Therapy (ABGT) weekly radioshows for many years including their milestone episode celebration events, and it's one of my favourite ways to discover new music, artists and labels. I was fortunate to see Cosmic Gate live during my first gig at the Forum De Beyrouth in Beirut in 2011 followed by Armin van Buuren in 2013 during ASOT 600 Beirut, in addition to other trance artists and legends such as Kyau & Albert, Dash Berlin, John O'Callaghan, Ferry Corsten and Markus Schulz.

My favourite electronic genres are trance and house, and I enjoy techno, chillout/downtempo and the occasional drum and bass. My favourite and preferred styles, sounds and subgenres are progressive, uplifting and deep, and I like melodic, orchestral, epic, classical, oriental and dark elements and influences. In general, I believe good music is good music, regardless of genre or subgenre.

Music is much more than a hobby or passion; it is deeply philosophical, and one of my main creative outlets and best forms of self-expression. Music is a universal religion and universal language â€“ it speaks directly to emotion and transcends all communication barriers. Music has had a profound impact on my life and is a huge source of inspiration as my dream fuel. I have never seen anything more powerful in uniting people, and I always see the magic happen when people come together regardless of their differences or backgrounds for their shared love of music. I love sharing music and being able to spread happiness and tell stories through crafting uplifting, emotional and thoughtful musical journeys.

I used Ableton as my digital audio workstation and took a step back from working on music during college to focus on my studies, but I have a lot more to learn and I'm looking forward to getting back into it in the near future and have a lot of exciting projects planned. I am also planning to move my mixing and production setup from Ableton to Bitwig, especially since I am now using Linux as my daily driver.
