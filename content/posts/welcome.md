Welcome to my blog!

This will be a home for my thoughts, opinions and perspectives, and a place to share my ideas, projects, guides and documentation. I aim to make my guides and documentation accessible and user-friendly to anyone regardless of technical background, where possible or necessary.

You can find out and explore more about me and my background [here](/about), where I cover my main areas, passions and interests. If you would like to reach out, connect, need help or have any questions, you can get in touch through your preferred channels [here](/contact).

I have a lot of stuff coming up, including several music projects that I have been planning for a long time, and I can't wait to share it with the world. You can subscribe to any updates by following my RSS feed [here](/rss).
